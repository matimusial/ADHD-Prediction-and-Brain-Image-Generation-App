        <h2>Instructions for the Administrator</h2>

        <h3>1. Familiarization with the Code Before Running the Program</h3>
        <p>Before starting work with the application, it is recommended to become familiar with the project's source code. The user interface (UI) is a demonstration version, and full functionality of the program is available through direct interaction with the code. If you plan to perform more advanced operations, it is better to use the code directly rather than relying on the UI.</p>

        <h3>2. Access to the Model Database and Management</h3>
        <p>The administrator has full access to the model database. This allows for quick browsing and deletion of models without the need for additional database management applications.</p>

        <h3>3. Running CNN Training for MRI Data</h3>
        <p>The administrator can run CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) training for MRI data, but only for files located in the <code>mri_real_files</code> folder. To correctly run the training, appropriate files must be prepared in advance. The project is optimized for data shaped as <strong>120x120x1</strong> and has not been tested with other sizes.</p>
        <p>From the user interface, it is possible to adjust parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and test size. You can also add your own description of the training. After completing the training, there is an option to easily add the newly trained model to the database. During training, metrics are displayed on the UI graph.</p>

        <h3>4. Handling Files for CNN</h3>
        <p>For CNN training, the administrator can work with three types of files: <strong>CSV</strong>, <strong>EDF</strong>, and <strong>MAT</strong>. The core of the project is based on MAT files, and the other formats have been adapted to match the MAT format.</p>
        <p>If the administrator wants to train the model on another group of patients with files in different formats, they can use conversion functions available in the <code>helpers_unused.py</code> file. It is recommended to review the <code>read_eeg_raw</code> function, which prepares the data for further processing. The project was trained on data sized <strong>19x128</strong>, and the data frame size has only been tested superficially.</p>
        <p>To correctly load files through the UI, the user must select a folder that contains two subfolders: <code>adhd</code> (data for patients with ADHD) and <code>control</code> (data for healthy patients), with the respective EEG files.</p>

        <h3>5. GAN Training</h3>
        <p>The training of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) models is conducted similarly to CNN training for MRI data. During the training, graphs and images from the network's generator are generated in the interface. It is worth noting that for GAN models, the generator loss is the average of all the losses collected during training, with each loss being recorded every 5% of the total epochs.</p>

        <h3>6. UI Usage vs. Code Operation</h3>
        <p>The user interface was designed as a superficial support tool. For more advanced operations, the administrator should work directly with the project code, using the UI only as a supportive aid.</p>

        <h3>7. Hardware Resource Consideration</h3>
        <p>Please note that training processes, especially for GAN models, are very resource-intensive and may take a long time, especially with large datasets. It is recommended to run these processes on professional machine learning hardware with adequate memory and computational power. Otherwise, training may significantly slow down the system.</p>

        <h3>8. GAN Training Warning</h3>
        <p>When starting GAN training, a warning message appears stating that generating synthetic data using GAN models can be time-consuming, particularly for large datasets. Make sure that your system has enough resources and patience for the process to complete.</p>

        <h2>Instructions for the Doctor</h2>

        <h3>1. Loading MRI and EEG Data</h3>
        <p>The doctor can load data using the <strong>"Load data"</strong> button at the top of the screen. The supported formats are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MRI</strong>: <strong>.nii</strong> format,</li>
            <li><strong>EEG</strong>: <strong>.mat</strong>, <strong>.csv</strong>, and <strong>.edf</strong> formats.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All loaded data must correspond to the formats used by the administrator to train and process the models. The "MRI models" and "EEG models" sections allow the selection of the model to use for prediction, where each model name corresponds to its accuracy.</p>

        <h3>2. Checking Multiple Files Simultaneously</h3>
        <p>The doctor can load and check multiple MRI or EEG files at once using the appropriate fields: <strong>"MRI files"</strong> or <strong>"EEG files"</strong>. The prediction result will be the average of all selected files.</p>

        <h3>3. Selecting a Model and Making Predictions</h3>
        <p>After loading the files, select the appropriate model from the "MRI models" or "EEG models" lists. The chosen model will appear in the fields <strong>"Chosen model EEG"</strong> or <strong>"Chosen model MRI"</strong>. Click the <strong>"Predict"</strong> button to start the prediction process. The results will be displayed in the appropriate tabs:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>EEG tab</strong>: EEG signals will be displayed as plots,</li>
            <li><strong>MRI tab</strong>: MRI images will be displayed with options to switch planes and files using the navigation buttons.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Viewing MRI Images Used for Model Training</h3>
        <p>The left panel provides additional options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>"Show Real Brain Examples"</strong>: Allows the doctor to view real MRI images used for training CNN or GAN models.</li>
            <li><strong>"Show Generated Brain Examples"</strong>: Enables the display of MRI images generated by the best GAN model, allowing a comparison between real and generated images.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Generating New Brain Images</h3>
        <p>The <strong>"Generate New Brain Image"</strong> option allows the doctor to generate new brain images from the models stored in the database. Each generated image can be saved individually to a file.</p>

        <h3>6. Additional Options</h3>
        <p>Once the task is completed, the doctor can switch back to the admin view using the <strong>"Admin View"</strong> button or exit the application by clicking the <strong>"Exit"</strong> button.</p>
